1. Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.
2. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time.
3. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism.
4. Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing, but it's gaining broader interest due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling.
5. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years,parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.
